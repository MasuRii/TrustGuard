# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 26, 2026**

TrustGuard ("we", "us", or "the app") is designed with a "privacy-by-default" and "offline-first" philosophy. This means your financial data stays where it belongs: on your device.

## 1. Data Collection
TrustGuard **does not collect, store, or transmit** any of your personal or financial data to external servers.

- **No Accounts:** You do not need to create an account or provide an email address to use the app.
- **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party tracking or analytics services that monitor your usage.
- **No Cloud Sync:** Your data is not synced to any cloud service by default.

## 2. Local Data Storage
All information you enter into TrustGuard—including groups, members, expenses, transfers, and photo attachments—is stored locally on your device in a secure SQLite database.

- **Storage Location:** Data is kept within the app's private storage area on your device.
- **Data Persistence:** Your data remains on your device until you manually delete the app or clear its storage.

## 3. Data Sharing (User-Initiated Only)
TrustGuard only shares data when you explicitly choose to do so. This includes:

- **Exports:** When you use the "Export to CSV" or "Share Summary" features, the app generates a file or text which is then handled by your device's native sharing system.
- **Backups:** When you create a backup file, it is stored on your device or shared via your choice of destination.
- **Reminders:** Local notifications are scheduled on your device and do not involve external servers.

## 4. Permissions
The app may request the following permissions to enable specific features:

- **Camera/Gallery:** To allow you to attach photos of receipts to transactions.
- **Notifications:** To remind you about outstanding balances (processed entirely on-device).
- **Biometrics:** To provide an optional security layer for accessing the app.

## 5. Your Rights
Since all data is stored locally, you have full control over it:
- You can view, edit, or delete any record at any time.
- You can delete all app data by uninstalling the app.
- You can export your data to take it with you.
