# User Guide

Welcome to TrustGuard! This guide will help you get the most out of your offline-first expense tracker.

## 1. Getting Started
TrustGuard is designed to be simple and private. There are no accounts to create and no data is ever sent to the cloud.

### Your Dashboard
The home screen features a global overview of your financial state across all active groups.
- **Your Overview:** See at a glance the total amount you owe and the amount owed to you across all groups.
- **Recent Activity:** Quickly view the last 5 transactions from any of your groups.
- **Quick Navigation:** Tap any group to view its specific details and transactions.

### Creating Your First Group
1. Tap the **New Group** button on the home screen.
2. Enter a name for your group (e.g., "Trip to Paris" or "Roommates").
3. Select the base currency for the group. All balances will be calculated in this currency.
4. Tap the **Check** icon in the top right to save.

Once a group is created, you need to add the people who will be sharing expenses.
1. Open your group and tap **Manage** next to the Members section.
2. Tap the **Person Add** icon at the bottom.
3. Enter their name and tap the **Check** icon.
*Tip: You don't need their phone numbers or emails; TrustGuard only needs a name to track their balance.*

### Organizing Members and Tags
You can customize the order in which members and tags appear in selectors.
1. Go to the **Members** or **Tags** screen.
2. Press and hold the **drag handle** (three horizontal lines) on any item.

## 2. Recording Transactions
There are two main types of transactions in TrustGuard: Expenses and Transfers.

### Recording Expenses

1. Tap **Add Expense** in the Quick Actions section of a group.
2. Enter the amount and a **Note** (description).
3. Select who paid using the horizontal **Member Avatar Selector**.
4. Choose how to split the cost under **Split between**:
   - **Equally:** The cost is divided evenly among all selected members.
   - **Custom:** Manually enter the specific amount each person owes. Use the split preview bar to ensure the totals match.
5. (Optional) Add tags or attach a photo of the receipt.
6. Tap the **Check** icon to save.

### Recording Transfers (Settlements)
Use transfers when one person gives money directly to another to settle a debt.
1. Tap **Add Transfer** in the Quick Actions section of a group.
2. Select who is sending the money and who is receiving it.
3. Enter the amount and tap the **Check** icon.

- **Swipe Actions:** In the transaction list, swipe **right** on an item to edit it, or swipe **left** to delete it.
- **Undo Accidental Deletions:** If you accidentally delete a transaction, you can immediately tap **Undo** on the notification at the bottom. You have a 5-second window to restore your data.

### Smart Amount Suggestions
TrustGuard learns from your habits to suggest common amounts.
- When entering an expense or transfer, you'll see chips with suggested amounts.
- These are based on your most **frequent** and **recent** transactions in that group.
- Tap a chip to instantly fill the amount field.

## 3. Understanding Balances
TrustGuard keeps track of exactly how much each person has paid and how much they owe.

- **Positive Balance (Green):** This person is owed money because they have paid more than their share.
- **Negative Balance (Red):** This person owes money to the group.

### Balance Progress Visualization
To help you grasp the relative magnitude of debts, the **Balances** screen and **Dashboard** feature bidirectional progress bars.
- Zero is in the center.
- Green bars grow right (credit), red bars grow left (debt).
- All bars are scaled consistently against the largest balance in the group.

### Settlement Suggestions
To make settling up easy, TrustGuard calculates the most efficient way to get everyone to a zero balance.
1. Tap **Balances** in the Quick Actions section of a group.
2. Tap the **Wallet** icon to see **Settlements**.
3. TrustGuard will show a list of suggested transfers grouped contextually:
   - **Action Required:** Transfers you need to make.
   - **Incoming:** Money you are expected to receive.
   - **Other Settlements:** Suggested transfers between other group members.
4. You can tap **Pay Now** or **Mark as Paid** on any suggestion to quickly record the transfer.
